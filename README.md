## Abstract

Stance detection plays a key role in analyzing public opinion in political debates, social media, and misinformation studies. However, existing methods typically treat targets as monolithic entities, overlooking their multifaceted nature and restricting the granularity of stance modeling. In this paper, we introduce *AspectStance*, a framework that performs unsupervised aspect discovery and exploits the discovered aspects for fine-grained stance classification. The approach first augments input texts with contextual explanations generated by a large language model. The enriched texts are then encoded using a GPT model to obtain text embeddings. For each target, we cluster the embeddings of its related texts using X-Means, uncovering latent aspects that are specific to that target. Each text is assigned an aspect based on its cluster membership. Next, we train a target-specific model that learns to assess the stance of a text with respect to its aspect for that target. For a new instance, we first identify the most relevant aspect cluster based on embedding similarity, and then classify its stance using that aspect. Experiments on the P-Stance and SemEval-2016 Task 6 datasets show consistent gains over strong target-only baselines, with an average F1 score improvement of 7.4% across targets. By explicitly tying predictions to discovered aspects, our method substantially improves interpretability, enabling more transparent aspect-oriented stance analysis.
